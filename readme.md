# FFT Multiplication

FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Multiplication ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm#Fourier_transform_methods)) is one of the fastest currently known algorithms for multiplying large integers.

This repo contains a basic Java implementation of the algorithm, including a GUI showing the intermediate Fourier Transforms of both operands, and the FT resulting from their convolution before being processed into the final result.

To test the program, compile and run the FFTMultiplicationMod.java file. Running it will pop up the GUI, which allows you to input two integers A and B, and obtain the result C, while seeing the intermediate Fourier Transforms.

Download and view the included PowerPoint slides to get a general outline of how the algorithm works.
